# DGUS-reloaded NWa Version

For 480x480 display
Laser and 3D printer mode

DWIN T5L touchscreen firmware for 3D printers/Laser running Marlin.

Requires using a modified version of Marlin to work properly, which can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/nwaelti/Marlin).

## Disclaimer
**This software is provided without any warranty. You are solely responsible for your use of it.**

## Features

This firmware was inspired by Creality printers' touchscreen firmware. Some features include:

* Status message available on most screens
* Z offset, manual and automatic leveling
* User confirmation screen (used by the filament runout procedure for example)
* Power loss recovery
* Custom G-code input (requires updating the touchscreen's core firmware (Work-In-Progress))
* PID autotuning
* Volume adjustment (saved to EEPROM)
* Brightness adjustment (saved to EEPROM)
* EEPROM reset shortcut
* BLTouch reset shortcut (if a BLTouch is installed)
* Print statistics (on the informations screen)
* Playing sounds using M300 (the frequency parameter is the index of the audio file)

Focus was also put on making this firmware as easy and safe to use as possible from a user perspective.

## Compatibility
This firmware **should** be compatible with printers equipped with the following hardware:

* 480x480 DWIN T5L touchscreen
* Single extruder
* Laser
* Heated bed
* Single controllable fan
* Bed leveling sensor (including a BLTouch)

It **could** also work on machines equipped with more hardware (dual extruder, etc.) but will lack on-screen controls for such hardware.

## Prerequisites
You have to compile and flash this [modified version of Marlin](https://github.com/nwaelti/Marlin) with `DGUS_LCD_UI_RELOADED` defined in the configuration.


## Modification / Compilation
You can make modifications to the firmware by opening the `Project.dgus` file in **DGUS Tools v8.0.11**.

After finishing your modifications, you will need to press the *Generate* button to create the 3 required binary files.

You can then run the rename script and flash your touchscreen using the resulting `DWIN_SET` folder.
